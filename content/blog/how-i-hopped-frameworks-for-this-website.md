# How I hopped frameworks for this website

::tldr
I started with [T3](https://create.t3.gg/), then moved to [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), back to [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [Solid](https://solidjs.com/), and finally settled on [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) for this website. Each framework had its strengths and weaknesses, but Nuxt.js provided the best developer experience and performance for my needs.
